        <h2></h2>
        <p>The Golgari Swarm is the embodiment of life and death.[2][3] The teeming masses of the Swarm believe that life and death are both natural [4] and equally essential too.[2] To them, life and death are natural elements of a cycle with no intermediary break.[5][6][7] Growth is power that comes slowly, but it is also ruthless and inevitable, and this makes growth a key virtue of the Swarm's power.[5][8] [2] with their dead being planted and regrown as plant–zombies. [9] Their reanimation magic has made the Golgari the largest Ravnican guild.[10] [11] Much like a swarm of insects, the Golgari often seem to behave more like a single organism than as a group of individuals.[12] The whole Swarm is driven by a primal instinct to survive and reproduce.

            The Golgari Swarm consists of many sub-factions, each with its own agenda. Their revered parun is the legendary necromancer Svogthir, the "god-zombie".
            
            During the Ravnica block storyline, the leadership of the Golgari was contested time and again, in large part due to the numerous factions vying for control of their guild.[8] The most prominent among these were the Devkarin (dark elves), of which Savra was the head, and the Teratogens, which was predominantly composed of plant–zombie hybrids as well as, albeit to lesser extents, giant bats, gorgons, harpies, and other monstrous creatures.[8][13] Up until the events of the Decamillennial, the Teratogens maintained hegemony over the Golgari Swarm.[13]

    Less than a millennium prior to the Decamillennial, the Sisters of Stone Death, originally a quintet of gorgons, attempted to overthrow parun Svogthir. Although two of the sisters died, they were successful in their coup and were able to destroy, and rot away, all but Svogthir's head, which his necromantic magic kept intact.[13] The remaining three sisters — Ludmilla, Lexya, and Lydya[6] — kept Svogthir under arrest in a tomb in Grigor Canyon.[13]

    At the turn of the Decamillennial, the Devkarin, led by matka (high priestess) Savra, who, with the help of the House Dimir parun and guildmaster Szadek, overtook control of the guild. Savra resurrected Svogthir, whom she used to overthrow the Sisters of Stone Death, and then used ancient, powerful matka magic to liberate his spirit from his head so that she could add it to her scepter. Subsequent to this, Savra proclaimed herself as the new Golgari guildmaster.[13]

    Power-hungry as always, Savra then attempted to infiltrate the Selesnya Conclave with her quietmen and tried to subtly seize control of the Conclave; but, she was double-crossed by Szadek, who snapped her neck so as to weaken the Conclave.[13]

    In Dissension, Szadek is defeated with the help of Savra's brother, Jarad, who assumes control of the Golgari Swarm. He was later sacrificed by Izolda (Lyzolda, the Blood Witch) as part of a ritual to arouse Rakdos, the parun of the Cult of Rakdos.[20] Jarad, however, "survives", by using necromancy to become a zombie/lich, and retains his mantle of leadership over the Golgari.[21]

    The guildhall of the Golgari Swarm in the Ravnica block is Svogthos, a former elaborately decorated and gilded cathedral of the Orzhov Syndicate. Svogthos is a semi-living structure in which the detached, severed head of Svogthir, is housed,[13] and is claimed to move as the center of Golgari territory shifts.[8]

    Return to Ravnica block
    Jarad was the next guildmaster of the Golgari Swarm.

    After the dissolution of the guilds, the Golgari had stayed more or less as they were. For 10,000 years, they had been the silent machine that kept the unsavory but essential parts of Ravnica running and knew no other life apart from the dank tunnels of the undercity.

    Jarad maintained his power, quelling without mercy any rumblings of mutiny or dissent from the Teratogens. He bided his time, knowing that the surface world was suffering without the structure and support of the guilds, and it was only a matter of time before things returned to business as usual.[20]

    Korozda is sometimes named as the new Golgari guildhall.[2] Actually, this immense circular maze of overgrown, fungus-encrusted ruins surrounds the arched Svogthos cathedral.[12] Korozda was the lair of guildmaster Jarad and the place where he met with his irregular court of attendants. It's patrolled by an array of swarming vermin, giant insects, and zombies.
